For the background music ducking, I put the background music into a high-pass filter set to cut off at 800 to filter out the lower frequencies. I set the gain glide to 0.2 when the voices are playing and made the gain and glide times longer to have the volume smoothly change. The background music gain and voices 1 and 2 then go through the master gain. When the voices are done playing, the background music is then set to unduck.

I recorded myself for the voiceovers and normalized them to make them a consistent volume. I also trimmed off excess audio at the start and end of each file.
